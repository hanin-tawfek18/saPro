<p><h3>Python is a programming language that is interpreted, object-oriented, and considered to be high-level prorramming language. Python is one of the easiest yet most useful programming languages which is widely used in the software industry. People use Python for Competitive Programming, Web Development, and creating software. Due to its easiest syntax, it is recommended for beginners who are new to the software engineering field. Its demand is growing at a very rapid pace due to its vast use cases in Modern Technological fields like Data Science, Machine learning, and Automation Tasks. For many years now, it has been ranked among the top Programming languages.</h3></p>

    <td class="pros-column">
       <mark><b> Ease of Use: </b></mark>Python has a simple, concise, and straightforward syntax. A Python program looks a lot like plain English and is highly readable. This makes Python programs easy to read and debug. Python’s control structures are intuitive and easy to use. In addition, Python is dynamically typed, so there is no requirement to declare the type of each variable. For these reasons, Python is one of the most efficient and productive languages.
<mark><b>Gentle Learning Curve:</b></mark> Python is one of the simpler languages to learn and is a good option for people learning to program. Programmers switching to Python from languages like C or Java can quickly reach peak efficiency. The Python package contains a useful Integrated Development and Learning Environment (IDLE).
<mark><b>Versatility:</b></mark> Python is a flexible, general purpose language that fully supports both procedural and object-oriented programming. Due to its built-in and third-party packages, it is suitable for a wide range of tasks. It is dominant in the areas of data science and machine learning. It is also widely used for back-end web development and the Internet of Things (IoT). Even when it is not the best choice for a particular task, it is usually still a viable option. In addition, Python code can be embedded into projects written in other languages, such as C++, and code from other languages can be embedded in Python.
<mark><b>Efficient for Rapid Development:</b></mark> Because Python is easy to use and does not have to be compiled, programs take less time to develop. Python programs are typically much shorter than equivalent programs in other languages. It is a great choice for quickly constructing prototypes in a rapid software development environment.
<mark><b>True Portability:</b></mark> A huge Python advantage is that it can be written once and run anywhere. Python does not have to be compiled in advance, so users run a true Python program and not a Python executable. The program is not compiled until it is run, using the platform-specific PVM. This means any Python program can potentially run on any system that supports Python.

    </td>
    <td class="cons-column">
        <mark><b>Not Very Fast:</b></mark> Python is much slower than more efficient languages like C and Java. Python is interpreted and dynamically-typed, so the run-time compiler has a lot of work to do. It must constantly validate the type of each variable. This means Python is not the best choice for scenarios where speed is critical.
<mark><b>Memory Intensive:</b></mark> Python is not optimized to reduce memory. It can use ten times the RAM as a program written in a more frugal language. However, this is partly a tradeoff in return for flexibility and ease of use. In addition, the Python garbage collector cannot gather all discarded resources immediately, which reduces the amount of available memory. Python is not a good choice for memory-constrained environments.
<mark><b>Harder to Avoid Runtime Errors: </b></mark>Python is not compiled until runtime and is dynamically typed. Therefore, many problems that would otherwise be caught by the compiler do not appear until the program runs. This might include something as simple as a syntax error, but it can include problems like trying to add an integer and a string together.
<mark><b>Not Much Traction in Mobile or Desktop Applications:</b></mark> Because it is somewhat slow and uses a lot of memory, Python has not made gains in the mobile space. There are some Python development tools for mobile apps, but they are more limited than frameworks for other languages. The situation is a bit better in client desktops, but Python is still not too popular for front-end applications.
<mark><b>Not Optimized for Database Access:</b></mark> It is more difficult to work with databases in Python than in some other applications. Python lacks a powerful, high quality, easy-to-use interface like the Java Database Connectivity (JDBC). It can still be used if the database reads and writes are relatively straightforward. But it is not the best choice for applications that have complex interactions with a large corporate database.
