                        <h2>Diffrence Between C Langyage And C++ Language</h2>
                        <p class="e">C is a foundational programming language known for its procedural or structural approach, emphasizing the sequence of operations to be executed. It allows direct interaction with hardware and offers efficient performance, making it ideal for developing operating systems, compilers, and embedded systems. C's design is characterized by its simplicity and the provision for low-level memory access, which contributes to its speed and portability across different platforms. The language supports modular programming through its rich library of pre-defined functions, facilitating the development of reusable code.</p>
                        <p class="e">C++, on the other hand, extends C by integrating object-oriented programming (OOP) features, enhancing the language's capability to manage complex software systems. OOP in C++ focuses on data encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism, enabling developers to create programs using objects and classes. This paradigm shift allows for better organization of code and promotes code reusability and maintainability. C++ also introduces advanced memory management techniques, exception handling, templates for generic programming, and the Standard Template Library (STL) for a rich set of container classes and algorithms. These features, combined with the ability to perform low-level operations, make C++ a versatile choice for applications ranging from system software to game development, graphical applications, and real-time simulation.</p>
